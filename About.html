    <h2>David Peh: Founder of D&D Health Care Education and Training Center</h2>
    <p>
      David Peh is a dedicated educator, nurse, and mentor whose passion for education and healthcare has shaped the lives of many aspiring nurses. As the founder of D&D Health Care Education and Training Center, he is committed to helping nursing students in the Cincinnati area overcome academic challenges and achieve their career goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Life and Teaching Career in Ghana</h2>
    <p>
      David’s journey in education began in Ghana, where he developed a deep love for teaching. He graduated in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from the University of Cape Coast, a prestigious institution known for its excellence in science and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after graduation, David began teaching Chemistry at the Ghana Armed Forces Senior High and Technical School in Burmah Camp, Accra. His engaging approach to simplifying complex scientific concepts quickly earned him respect among students. He later taught Integrated Science at Tema Technical Training Institute, further expanding his teaching expertise and mentorship skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Transition to Nursing in the United States</h2>
    <p>
      Driven by a desire to explore new opportunities and make a greater impact, David immigrated to the United States. He pursued nursing at Christ College of Nursing and Health Sciences, where he graduated in 2018 and passed the NCLEX on his first attempt, becoming a registered nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      David started his career as a psychiatric nurse, supporting patients with complex mental health needs. This experience deepened his empathy and clinical competence and solidified his commitment to holistic, evidence-based care.
    </p>

    <h2>Advancing in Nursing and Education</h2>
    <p>
      In 2020, David earned a Master’s degree in Nursing Education from Xavier University. This academic achievement, combined with his practical experience, opened the door to a faculty position teaching mental health and chronic care in an ADN (Associate Degree in Nursing) program.
    </p>
    <p>
      While teaching, David also worked as a medical-surgical nurse, blending real-world practice with his passion for educating future nurses. His innovative teaching strategies and mentorship style helped countless students navigate nursing school successfully.
    </p>

    <h2>Founding D&D Health Care Education and Training Center</h2>
    <p>
      David was inspired to create the center after mentoring PCAs and STNAs who struggled in nursing programs due to lack of support or academic difficulty. Under his guidance, many of these students regained their confidence, returned to school, and completed their programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Witnessing their growth and success firsthand, David saw the need for structured academic support tailored to nursing students. Thus, D&D Health Care Education and Training Center was born—providing tutoring, test prep, and personalized mentorship to help aspiring nurses succeed.
    </p>

    <h2>Commitment to Education and Mentorship</h2>
    <p>
      Today, David continues to inspire and empower future nurses through D&D Health Care Education and Training Center. His mission is to bridge the gap between academic struggle and professional success, offering support, knowledge, and encouragement every step of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strong foundation in both education and clinical practice, David Peh remains a powerful advocate for nursing students in Cincinnati and beyond.
